        <h1>Wander</h1>
        <p>Designing an app service that provides college students with another option of safely getting home at night.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="caseStudy">

        <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>Wander is an app that aims to provide safe walking transportation by connecting college students who have similar destinations with walking buddies. 
            We didn’t design Wander to be a replacement for campus transportation or ridesharing services, but rather, an alternative—with one click, you have 
            access to students minutes away, ready to walk alongside you. Once a student enters their desired 
            destination, Wander uses the student’s current location to curate results based on a combination of current distance from other students, distance 
            between students’ final destinations, and ratings based on past walks. 
          </p>

          <h5>Problem</h5>
            <p>The main form of transportation for college students is walking since ridesharing is not affordable for all students, public transportation is not available on closed campuses, 
              and campus services are often slow and unreliable. However, many students feel unsafe walking alone at night. We believe that students need more access to options for staying safe at night as incidents of robberies and sexual assault often 
              occur right on campus grounds. From personal experience to the voiced opinions of our peers, there is a clear consensus that there is safety and comfort in numbers.
              This led us to start brainstorming a solution. 
            </p>

          <h5>The Team</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Ashley Sidoryk</li>
              <li>Nisha Sukumar</li>
              <li>Ami Nachiappan</li>
            </ul>

          <h5>The Goal</h5>
            <p>Create an accessible alternative for college students while ensuring their safety.</p>

          <h5>The Process</h5>
            <p>add a visual here***</p>


        <h3>Research</h3>
          <p>In order to get a better understanding of the opinions our potential users have on this issue as well as 
            what they would like to see from this service, we created a detailed survey, which we sent out to students from various universities, 
            about their personal experiences when it came to walking at night and the current transportation services available to them. The responses gathered provided us 
            with insightful feedback on our proposition and aided us in creating a more formulated framework for our app.</p>

          <h5>Personal Experience</h5>
            <p>As a team of female New York University students ourselves, this idea stemmed from our personal experiences of having to walk back to our dorms 
              alone at night. As NYU's campus is right within New York City, students are exposed to ......*** add more
            </p>

          <h5>User Survey Stats</h5>
            <p>In a survey conducted with 56 college students across the country, 80% of students indicated that they feel unsafe to very unsafe 
              when walking alone on campus at night. This is an even more heightened issue on college campuses in larger cities or hybrid campuses such as NYU.</p> 
              <br>
             
             <h6><b>"I have had a few incidents walking alone at night in college. Men have tried to reach out to grab or touch me. Thankfully they weren't committed to follow through with the acts but it shows that incidents like 
              these can happen on campus. I would have felt a lot better if I were walking with more people and after those incidents, I made sure to ask my friends who lived in other dorms and if they could walk me back to mine."</b></h6>
              <br>
    
              <p>Limited campus services that do provide security and transportation at night are inefficient, causing long wait times. For example, NYU has Safe Ride, 
              a service that provides shuttle transportation between NYU buildings from 12am - 7am on weekdays. But, 80% of the surveyed NYU students that have used 
              Safe Ride were unsatisfied or very unsatisfied with the service. Safe Ride’s goal is to provide fast transportation via shuttle buses for students, 
              but it falls short of its goal as 63% of students surveyed have had to wait for more than 30 minutes for a ride. 76% of surveyed users who used Safe Ride 
              have booked a ride, canceled it, and ended up walking due to long wait times. This causes user frustration as students want quick and convenient forms of 
              transportation home after long nights of studying.</p> 
              <br>
              
              <h6><b>“I've tried to call Safe Ride often from Bobst [library] at 2AM to go back to Gramercy [Residence Hall], which is a very far walk, but I always ended up canceling the request because I felt it was taking too long.”</b></h6>
              <br>
              
              <p>For other colleges, it was indicated that 78% of the surveyed colleges have a service that provides transportation at night; however, 56% of participants stated that they have never used the service and 35% who have stated it would
              have been faster to walk, thus showing that not only is walking the preferred method of transportation on campuses but the available services do not meet the expectations of students.</p>
              <br>
              
              <h6><b>"From personal experiences I'd love to find other students to walk with because my college is in a pretty secluded area and the campus buildings are pretty distanced. I'm always spooked around 1AM walking by myself and since our campus is pretty open, the  
              public can enter as they please :("</b></h6>
              <br>
              
              <p>College students should not, and with Wander, they do not, have to pay for their safety on campus. Our survey has also confirmed our product-market fit: 96% of students surveyed expressed that they would use a service like Wander on their college campuses.</p>

          

        <h3>Ideation</h3>
          <p>Our goal was to create an app that is accessible to all students that was not only user friendly, but 
            incorporated enough safety features .... (describing the feel of comfort when using the app)*** add more 

          </p> 

          <h5>Proposed Ideas</h5>
            <p>Before beginning the design process, we formulated a basic outline of the framework we wanted 
              to implement. We wanted to have the most basic purposes and functionalities in mind before diving deeper into 
              more complex features that reflected our user research feedback and user safety priorities.
