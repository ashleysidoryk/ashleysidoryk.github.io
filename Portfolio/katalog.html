        <h1>Katalog</h1>
        <p>Improving the way kpop fans trade and sell photocards in their collections.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="caseStudy">

        <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Katalog is a service that aims to provide photocard collectors with a safe platform where they can find information about specific 
                photocards (such as average market price) and buy/sell cards to expand their collections. The website acts as an archive with information 
                on cards that are available on the market so that users can reasonably price and buy photocards. Each photocard page shows which users are selling 
                and trading that particular photocard and a graph of current price trends. Users can also create a wishlist on their profile so other users can see what 
                cards they are looking for and possibly prompt a transaction. 
            </p>

            <h5>Problem</h5> 
                <p>A photocard is a random picture of a member from a Kpop group that is usually included in purchased Kpop albums. This in turn has led to a huge 
                trading market where fans trade for their favorite member's card and try to complete their collections, similar to baseball and pokemon card trading communities. 
                Currently, there is no defined platform where these transactions take place thus usually happening through Twitter, Instagram, Discord, and other social media platforms. 
                This makes it very difficult to find certain photocards as collectors must constantly search in and monitor several various platforms to find the most ideal deal. 
                Katalog was created as a way to alleviate the difficulties of buying/selling by bringing transactions onto one central platform in order to ease and facilitate collectors' experiences. 
                </p>

            <h5>The Team</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Rachel Lin</li>
                <li>Ashley Sidoryk</li>
                <li>Elizabeth Lee</li>
                <li>Lee Boodoo</li>
                <li>Juana Ng</li>
                <li>David Wang</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>My Role</h5>
                <p>I worked on all aspects of the project: UX/UI Design, Frontend Development, Backend Development.</p>

            <h5>The Goal</h5>
                <p>Create a platform where Kpop fans can make secure photocard transactions with one another.</p>


      <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>To gauge the validity of our problem statement, we decided to further look into the _____. We gathered personal statements as well as 
            took to social media to record exactly how these transactions were being executed. 
        </p>

        <h5>Personal Experience</h5>
            <p>Some members of our team have entered the Twitter photocard trading market before and </p>

        <h5>Social Media</h5>
            <p>From many accounts dedicated to trading news to users posting their own listings, it is evident that the photocard trading market is huge on these various social media platforms. 
                What we have observed the most however is that this buying and selling transactions are often facilitated by dedicated trading accounts that repost individual user's listings; we 
                can assume this ____ system came about as a way to combat security issues. But with the many users and accounts participating in the market spread across various social media platforms, 
                come the more ______ (복잡한) resulting in overlapping listings, longer search times, and _______.  
            </p>

      <h3>Ideation</h3>
        <p>We wanted to create a platform that centralized this ever-growing market especially with the rise of Kpop popularity worldwide. 
            The main issue we identified was the lack of security that comes with making such monetary transactions with strangers over social media. 
            Not only is there a high risk of scams with the lack of credibility, but also no way to enforce any type of safety and accountability for users. 
            We aim to help users ____.

            <ol>
                <li><i>Credibility and Accountability</i>: user ratings/reviews, chatting, charts to show current prices
                </li>
                <li><i>Content Overload</i>: filtered search, organizing by specific photocard rather than just showing all listings up front
                </li>
                <li><i>Secure Transactions</i>: venmo but later on authorized payment thru Katalog,  identity verification
                </li>
                <li><i>Keeping Track</i>: section of where they can keep wishlist, listings, history
                </li>
              </ol>

        <h5>Design</h5>
            <p>To begin our design process, we created a site map in order to visualize how we wanted our users to navigate Katalog. 
                We made note of what main pages we wanted to feature on our website and how they would interact with one another in order to 
                achieve a particular desired action.  
            </p>
            <img src="../images/Katalog-Map.png" id="appMap" alt="katalogWireframe" id="wanderWire">
            <br/>
            <p>We then moved on to wireframing the views of Katalog deriving from the created site map. As the search, photocard details/listings, and user profile screens 
                were the most integral aspects of our product, we focused heavily on the functionalities of these features.

      <h3>Project Learnings</h3>

        <h5>Key Takeaways</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><b>The more user research, the better the results!</b> Though personal experience is always telling, it does not encapsulate everyone's perspective. 
              For more improvement, a survey should be created and sent out to gain more opinions in order to quantify the need for this app as well as what can be included to 
              create a better experience for our users. In order to create a product that is best fit for our customer, taking their insight into account is essential for success. 
            </li>
            <li><b>Having many features shouldn't compromise usability!</b> It was a little difficult to balance all the features we wanted to include without having one compromise another. 
              This showed the importance of the design process as it helped us visualize and fully consider the interconnectivity within the app. Mapping out what was needed and which path was the most 
              user friendly not only prevented us from getting confused, but ensured that our users would have no issues when using Fridgloo. 
            </li>
