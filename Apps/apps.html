    <h3>Wander was created to tackle the issue of feeling unsafe on college campuses at night. While walking is the prime form of transportation on campuses because vehicle transportation and ride sharing services are not as efficient or affordable, many students feel unsafe walking alone at night. Wander is an app that connects college students in the same area with similar commutes. It is designed to provide safe walking transportation on campus and allow students to feel more comfortable while deterring crimes that target isolated individuals.</h3>
